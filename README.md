# Student-Performance-Prediction
This is a Python Backend Machine Learning Project based on the Supervised Learning model called Linear Regression.
This project tries to predict the Grade 3 of a particular student based on his previous two grades, study time , free time and absences.
I used the Linear Regression Model present in Scikit-Learn Library for predicting the Final Grade of the student.
Also, I tried to not only predict the grade, but also tried to give the student suggestions based on his predicted grade and the attributes that were given as input such as Free Time and Study Time.

Note: The sample dataset that I used for training and testing my model is attached as a csv file named FinalStuper.csv
